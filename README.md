This is a collection of files, configuration, and other things that I've created over time playing with Venus OS.

I hope it's helpful, ask any questions if you've got them!

Please see https://github.com/aaronsb/victronvenussupport/blob/master/venus_rpi_enablement.md for a more comprehsive list of tasks to make Venus OS on Raspberry PI easier to use.
